just got in a car accident and i wish it had been worse and that i had gotten fatally injured when i was driving sometimes i imagine just crashing into something and dying i have had some close calls recently with other drivers and i often think afterward that i wish they had ended up hitting me i dont know why i feel like this ive been taking sertraline the generic version of zoloft which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day to day basis but whenever something out of the ordinary happens like this car accident or i mess something up its like i had never taken the medsi feel like i both want to and dont want to die these last couple of years have been horrible for me but i still have dreams and want to do things before i started taking the sertraline i was actively planning my death but now its like i feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much this car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money and its all my fault maybe they would have gotten some compensation if i had died if i wasnt around anymore they would be sad but i also wouldnt be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymorei ama terrible daughter

why is mankind afraid of death lately i am asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays back in the middle ages for example of course you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that but today even if it is completly painless why would you struggle to just end it all i myself am not suicidal i would say even if i think about it more than often to just quit go the pussy but easy way why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown we dont know whats after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it like actual clinical dead but is is really the only reason like i know i am not going to kill myself yet and it probably stays that way because i am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy if you get what i mean
i want everyone to feel my pain i am sick of everyone trying to hold me down and take advantage of mei amsick of always being second choicei amsick of being neglected feared and hated i want everyone to feel my wrath and my pain i am sick of hiding in the shadows and just taking it all i want everything they ever did to me to happen to them and 100 times over i hope they never get reliefi amsick of people and i am not afraid to admit it and it makes me sick to see so many happy people with perfect lives they dont deserve it if i cant be happy why should anyone else be

@Boddingtons baby id try anything for the first time wi you...
ptsd and alcohol i had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago i was 21 nowi am26 i forgot about repressed it or whatever for several years something unrelated one day made me remember everything it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like i was reliving it all and felt like i was having a never ending panic attack for about 4 days this buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol pornography cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant waysi amafraid to talk about what happened to anyone even people i trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again and sometimesi amjust completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and cant escape them i tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and even t and gave up on the idea of therapy i dont know what to do i dont want to give up
@AMyburgh No problem.
